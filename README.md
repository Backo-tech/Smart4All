SMART4ALL - Knowledge Transfer Experiment (KTE) â€“ Call 3


Project name: Convergence of conventional manufacturing system to smart & sensible environment

Project Acronym: (CCMSS&SE)

# Knowledge Transfer description
EnergyPulse implemented noninvasive, scalable, flexible and customizable set of solutions in order to boost decision making within manufacturing, accompanied with increase in overall resource efficiency in a decentralized manner. EnergyPulse enabled DMD to benefit with the knowledge expansion in terms of complete event forensics and consumption quantification on observed processes/ machine operations as well as possibility to establish data-driven predictive maintenance system. The technology behind IoT nodes is based on CLEC principles and their role is to reveal in real time if the certain changes in machine operation stimulates energy efficiency. Upon behavior profile establishment an AI-based model is applied which opens the door to predictive maintenance by tracking the anomalies in the current and model-predicted machine behavior. As as its benefit, EnergyPulse recognizes potential business cooperation with partner and its connections on the EU market after successful realization of the project.
